<!--Project Description  -->

## Project Description

This project is meant to build a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 

Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.

## Setup Instruction

There is no any script required to run the application however you can visit the <strong>project link</strong>[here](https://chaxito.github.io/SafPrep2)


## Technologies Used

The program will basically use JavaScript as the programming language and bootstrap as the style language.
